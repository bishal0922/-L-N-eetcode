```Java
class Solution {

        //initializing our return variable max
        int max = 0;

        //creating our set and initializing our left pointer l 
        Set set = new HashSet();
        int l = 0;

        //iterating through the entire string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() ; i++){
            //while the character is in our set
            while (set.contains(s.charAt(i))){
                //we remove its pervious location and update our left pointer
                set.remove(s.charAt(l));
                l++;
            }
            //now we add the new character to the set
            set.add(s.charAt(i));
            //update the max as the longest sliding window is seem 
            //which is the result of the charact  ers between i and l pointer
            max = Math.max(max, i - l + 1);
        }
