## Product of Array Except Self

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        #prefix and postfix problem
        pre,post = 1,1
        r = [None] * len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            r[i] = pre
            pre *= nums[i]
        
      
        for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
            r[i] *= post
            post *= nums[i]

        return r
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we iterate through the input list twice, once in the first for loop and once in the second for loop, and in both loops we are performing constant time operations such as indexing and multiplication. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because we are creating a new list of size n to store the result.
