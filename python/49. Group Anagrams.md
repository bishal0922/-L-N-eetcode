## Group Anagrams

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        r = {}

        for s in strs:
            s2 = ''.join(sorted(s))
            if s2 not in r:
                r[s2] = list()
    
            r[s2].append(s)

        return (r.values())
```

## The time complexity of the given code is O(nklogk) and the space complexity is O(nk)

The time complexity is O(n*klogk) because the code iterates through the input list "strs" once, and for each string, it performs a sorting operation which has a time complexity of O(klogk) where k is the length of the string. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list "strs" and the length of the strings in the list.

The space complexity is O(n*k) because the code creates a dictionary "r" to store the anagrams of the input strings. The size of the dictionary is directly proportional to the number of unique anagrams, which is directly proportional to the number of distinct characters in the input strings. The size of the values of the dictionary is also directly proportional to the number of anagrams in the input list, thus the overall space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list "strs" and the length of the strings in the list.

Note that the code also creates a new string "s2" for each string in "strs" and this new string has a length of k, thus the space complexity of creating this new string is also O(k) and it should be taken into account.
