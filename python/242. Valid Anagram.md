# Valid Anagram

sol:
```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        #anagram if they're the same words spelled from either side
        bucket = [0] * 26

        for c in s:
            bucket[ord('a') - ord(c)]+=1
        for c in t:
            bucket[ord('a') - ord(c)]-=1

        for n in bucket:
            if n != 0:

## The time complexity of the given code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1)

The time complexity is O(n) because the code iterates through two input strings "s" and "t" once, and for each character in the strings, it performs a constant-time operation to update the values in the "bucket" list. The size of the bucket is a constant 26, thus the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input strings.

The space complexity is O(1) because the code creates a fixed-size list "bucket" with 26 elements to store the count of characters. The size of the bucket does not change based on the size of the input strings, so the overall space complexity is constant regardless of the size of the input strings.
