# Valid Palindrome

```python
class Solution:
    def isalphnum(self, c: str) -> bool:
        return c.isdigit() or c.isalpha()

    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = s.lower()

        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

        while (l < r):
            if not self.isalphnum(s[l]):
                l+=1
            elif not self.isalphnum(s[r]):
                r-=1
            else:
                if s[l] == s[r]:
                    l+=1
                    r-=1
                else:
                    return False
        
        return True
```

## This code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

The isPalindrome function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

The time complexity is O(n) because the while loop iterates through the elements of the input string "s" once and each iteration takes O(1) time. The function also calls the isalphnum() function, which takes O(1) time.

The space complexity is O(1) because the function only uses a few variables for the index pointers and the input string is not modified, which means that no additional space is used.
