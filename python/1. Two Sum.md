# Two Sum

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        map = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            comp = target - nums[i]
            if comp in map:
                #means the map has a value with the key "comp"
                return [map[comp], i]
            map[nums[i]] = i
        
        return []
```

## The time complexity of the given code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) because the code iterates through the input list "nums" once, and for each element in the list, it performs a constant-time operation to update the values in the "map" dictionary. The size of the map is linear with respect to the size of the input list, thus the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list.

The space complexity is O(n) because the code creates a dictionary "map" with n elements to store the count of characters. The size of the map is linear with respect to the size of the input list, so the overall space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list.
