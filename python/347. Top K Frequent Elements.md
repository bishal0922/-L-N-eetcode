## Top K Frequent Elements

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        r = [-1] * k 
        map = defaultdict(int)

        for n in nums:
            map[n]+=1

        bucket = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
        for val, freq in map.items():
            bucket[freq].append(val)
        
        c = 0
        for i in range(len(bucket) -1, -1, -1):
            if len(bucket[i]) > 0:
                for j in range(len(bucket[i])):
                    if c == k:
                        break
                    r[c] = bucket[i][j]
                    c+=1

        return r

```

## The time complexity of the given code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) because the code iterates through the input list "nums" once, for each element in the list, it performs a constant-time dictionary lookup and insertion operation. Then it iterates through all the elements of the bucket array and the frequency of the elements in the input list, which is also linear with respect to the size of the input list.

The space complexity is O(n) because the code creates a dictionary "map" to store the count of elements in the input list, and a bucket array "bucket" of size n+1 to store the elements based on their frequency. The size of the dictionary and bucket array is directly proportional to the size of the input list, so as the size of the input list increases, the space required by the dictionary and bucket array also increases. Thus, the overall space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list.

It is worth mentioning that the code uses a defaultdict which is a dictionary with a default value, in this case, the default value is 0. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

Also, it is worth mentioning that the output list "r" is pre-allocated with a size of k, which has a constant space of k. This is not considered in the space complexity analysis.

### Method 2: Heap


```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        map = {}

        for n in nums:
            if n not in map:
                map[n] = 0
            map[n]+=1

        heap = []

        for num, freq in map.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-freq, num))
        
        r = []
        for tup in range(k):
            x = heapq.heappop(heap)
            r.append(x[1])
            

        return r    
```

## The time complexity of the given code is O(nlogk) and the space complexity is O(n).

The time complexity is O(nlogk) because the code iterates through the input list "nums" once, for each element in the list, it performs a constant-time dictionary lookup and insertion operation. Then it iterates through all the elements in the dictionary and push them into a min heap with a time complexity of O(logk) for each insertion. As we iterate through all n elements in the input list, and we push them into the heap, the overall time complexity is O(nlogk).

The space complexity is O(n) because the code creates a dictionary "map" to store the count of elements in the input list, and a min heap "heap" to store the elements based on their frequency. The size of the dictionary and heap is directly proportional to the size of the input list, so as the size of the input list increases, the space required by the dictionary and heap also increases. Thus, the overall space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list.

Additionally, the heapq.heappush and heapq.heappop functions are used, which are implemented in a way that gives a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and deletion operations.
