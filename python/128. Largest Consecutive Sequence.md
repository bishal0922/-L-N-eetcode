# Largest Consecutive Sequence

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hset = set(nums)
        best = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] - 1 not in hset:
                n = nums[i]
                while n + 1 in hset:
                    n+=1
                best = max(best, n - nums[i] + 1)

        return best
```

## This code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). 

The time complexity is O(n) because the while loop inside the for loop will run at most n times and the for loop will run n times. The space complexity is O(n) because a set is used to store the elements of the input list "nums".

To expand further, let's take a closer look at the two main components of the code: the for loop and the while loop.

The for loop iterates through all the elements in the input list "nums". The length of "nums" is n, so the for loop runs in O(n) time. Inside the for loop, a check is made to see if the current element minus 1 is in the set "hset". This check is done in constant time O(1) because searching in a set has an average time complexity of O(1).

The while loop is used to count the number of consecutive elements in the set "hset" that are greater than the current element. Each iteration of the while loop increments the current element by 1, and then checks if the incremented element is in the set "hset". This check is also done in constant time O(1). The while loop will run at most n times because each element in the input list is checked once and the while loop will only run if the current element is the starting element of a sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n) because the for loop and the while loop both run in O(n) time, and the space complexity is O(n) because the set "hset" is used to store the elements of the input list "nums".

## Addional Notes - IMPORTANT

The time complexity of the code is O(n) because the for loop and the while loop are not nested and run independently of each other. The for loop runs through all the elements in the input list "nums" and takes O(n) time. The while loop runs for each element in the input list and it takes O(1) time for each iteration.

The while loop only runs if the current element from the for loop is the starting element of a sequence of consecutive integers, otherwise the while loop will not run. So, the number of times the while loop runs is determined by the number of sequences of consecutive integers in the input list, which is not directly related to the size of the input list. Therefore, the time complexity of the while loop is considered to be O(1) and not O(n).

The overall time complexity is the sum of time complexity of both loops. Since the while loop runs in O(1) time and the for loop runs in O(n) time, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(1) = O(n).

In summary, The while loop only runs in constant time and the for loop is the only one that runs in linear time, so the overall time complexity is O(n)
